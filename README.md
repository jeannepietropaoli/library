The goal of this project is to create a small Library app, where you can add / delete books to your collection. 

## Skills to practice

- Organizing code into factory functions
- Discover and use classes
- Having as little global variable as possible
- Working with a form element and use its inputs
- Use CSS grid
- DOM manipulations

## Features
Small book collection app where you can : 
- Add a new book with its details (title, author, page, status)
- Delete a book
- Mark a book as read
- Clean UI

## Improvements

- Add more details to the books objects
- Use only classes or factories (goal of this project was to get familiar with both)
- Split our code into modules (books, library, form)
